            <b>Camera requirements:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>Dedicated STABLE wired internet connection</li>
                <li>30 Mbps+ upload speed PER camera at location (speedtest.net)</li>
                <li>Camera devices:
                    <ul>
                        <li>IPhone with IOS 13+</li>
                        <li>Android phone with Android 9+</li>
                        <li>Windows 8.1+ computer with webcam capable of 30fps at 720p resolution (Logitech C920 HD Pro)</li>
                        <li>Camcorder that can connect to computer via usb as a webcam</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>Camera and microphone access allowed in device settings</li>
                <li>Ability to run zoom video call with no video glitches or stutters</li>
            </ul>
             <b>Each camera must:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>Stream for 5+ minutes</li>
                <li>Have rapid movement in front of the camera (an actual performance is best)</li>
                <li>Be observed by the administrator (you)</li>
            </ul>
             <b>What to check for:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>Blurry movement.  This is most likely from a low quality camera or computer
                    <ul>
                        <li>Find a better camera or adjusting your camera's settings (EG disable auto white-balance and lighting compensation)</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Glitches, freezing or pixelization. This is a connection issue
                    <ul>
                        <li>Ask multiple participants if they all see the same problem to make sure it is on the camera's end</li>
                        <li>Make sure the camera uses an ethernet cable</li>
                        <li>Have the camera run a speed test at <a href="https://www.speedtest.net/" target="_blank">speedtest.net</a> and make sure it meets the minimum requirements of 25Mbps upload per camera at the location
                            <ul>
                                <li>For example, if you will be running 2 cameras, you need to se 50Mbps upload speed</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Some camera may have a hard time connecting.  If so refresh the page and hit the start button again.</li>
                        <li>Upgrade your camera setup if nothing else works.</li>

           </b> Each judge needs to:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>Login to their appropriate role(s)</li>
                <li>Run through the judging process at least twice for each role</li>

                        <li>If these are not experienced by everyone it means they are specific to the judges system/internet.</li>
                        <li>Make sure they are connected to their internet via an ethernet cable.</li>
                        <li>If they are unable to reliably view the stream, they will be unable to judge and you may need to find a replacement.</li>
