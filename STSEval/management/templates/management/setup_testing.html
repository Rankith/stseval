                Testing with each new participant is <b>required</b>. After creation, your competition is in Test Mode by default<br/>
                This allows you to test cameras and judges, it must be disabled before the start of the competition.<br/>
                Disabling test mode resets the meet to the start and clears out routines and scores.<br/>

             <h2>Camera Testing</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="col-8 pt-2 pl-2" align="left">
            Each camera needs to:
            <ul>
                <li>Stream for 5+ minutes</li>
                <li>Have rapid movement in front of the camera (an actual performance would be best)</li>
                <li>Be observed by the administrator (you)</li>
            </ul>
            What to check for:
            <ul>
                <li>Blurry movement
                    <ul>
                        <li>This is most likely from a low quality camera or computer</li>
                        <li>Try finding a better camera or adjusting your camera's settings (disable auto white-balance and lighting compensation)</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Glitches, freezing or pixelization
                    <ul>
                        <li>This is a connection issue</li>
                        <li>Ask multiple participants if they all see it to make sure it is on the camera's end</li>
                        <li>Make sure the camera is using an ethernet cable</li>
                        <li>Have the camera run a speed test at <a href="https://www.speedtest.net/">speedtest.net</a> and make sure they meet the minimum requirements of 25Mbps upload per camera at the location</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Other issues
                    <ul>
                        <li>Some devices may have a hard time connecting.  Refresh the page and hit the start button again if this occurs.</li>
                        <li>Try another device if nothing else works.</li>

        </div>
        <div class="col-8 pt-2 pl-2" align="left">
            You should use this opportunity to train the judges on how to use the system.<br/>
            Each judge needs to:
            <ul>
                <li>Login to their appropriate role(s)</li>
                <li>Run through the judging process as if the competition was proceeding as normal at least twice for each role</li>
                <li>Observe a stream for at least 5 minutes and watch for glitches, freezing, pixelization or lagging behind the other viewers
                    <ul>
                        <li>If these are not experienced by everyone it means they are specific to their system/internet.</li>
                        <li>Make sure they are connected to their internet via an ethernet cable.</li>
                        <li>If they are unable to reliably view the stream, they will be unable to judge and you may need a replacement.</li>
                    </ul>
